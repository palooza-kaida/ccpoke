## Problem

You're using Claude Code on your computer. You step away with your phone but have no idea if Claude Code is done yet or what files it changed.

**ccpoke** is a lightweight bridge between Claude Code and Telegram — when Claude Code finishes, you get a notification right on your phone.

```

- 📂 **Git diff included** — see changed files without opening your computer
- ⏱ **Processing time** — know how long Claude Code took
- 📝 **Response summary** — quick glance at what Claude Code replied
- 🔐 **User whitelist** — only authorized users can use the bot
