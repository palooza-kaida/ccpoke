# Project Overview & Product Development Requirements

**ccpoke** — AI Agent Notification Bridge. A zero-config TypeScript/Node.js application that monitors when AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor) complete tasks and sends rich notifications to Telegram, with support for two-way chat and tmux session integration.

---

## Executive Summary

### Vision Statement

> **ccpoke** is a zero-config notification bridge for AI coding agents — supporting Claude Code, Cursor, and future agents with ease. When your AI agent completes a task, you get poked on your phone with a summary, git changes, and the ability to chat back.

### One-Liner

"Your AI agent pokes you when it's done — any agent, anywhere."

| **Phase 1: Foundation** | Claude Code notifications working, 50+ GitHub stars | ✅ Done (v1.5.4) |
| **Phase 2: Multi-Agent** | Support Cursor + Claude Code, 100+ weekly npm downloads | Q2 2026 |
| **Phase 3: Multi-Channel** | Discord + Slack support, 500+ stars | Q3 2026 |
| **Phase 4: Advanced** | Terminal streaming, file transfer | Q4 2026 |

- Checks phone for status updates

**Demographics:**
- Age: 25-50
- Technical level: Intermediate to advanced
- Platform: macOS, Linux, Windows (WSL)
- Frequency: Daily usage

### Secondary Users

- **Teams** — Multiple developers monitoring shared CI/CD-like agent runs
- **DevOps** — Monitoring long-running code generation tasks

- Auto-split long messages (pagination)
- User whitelist for security
- i18n support (EN, VI, ZH)

**Implementation:** ~v1.0-1.5.4

### Tier 2: Interactive Chat (In Progress)

**What:** Send messages from Telegram to agent session

**Features:**
- Two-way chat via tmux send-keys
- Session lifecycle management (tmux-based)
- Slash command forwarding (`/clear`, `/cost`, etc.)
- Permission handling (approve/deny)
- Progress indicator ("thinking")
- Desktop ↔ phone handoff (seamless)
- Message queue for concurrent inputs

### Tier 3: Terminal Monitoring (Planned)

**What:** View terminal activity in real-time

**Features:**
- Terminal screenshot on demand (`/screen`)
- Real-time output streaming
- Full keyboard control via Telegram
- File transfer (machine → phone)
- ANSI color rendering

---

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Background Task Notification

**Actor:** Solo developer

**Flow:**
1. Start Claude Code agent to refactor codebase
2. Walk away to attend meeting
3. Agent completes (5-15 minutes later)
4. Phone buzzes with notification
5. Read summary, git changes, execution time
6. Decide: continue work or review on desktop

**Value:** Awareness without constant monitoring

---

### Use Case 2: Quick Question in Chat

**Actor:** Developer at desk, wants to send message to agent

**Flow:**
1. Agent waiting for input
2. User sends message via Telegram (faster than switching windows)
3. Message injected into tmux session
4. Agent processes and responds
5. Response appears in Telegram
6. User reviews or sends follow-up

**Value:** Parallel communication channel

---

### Use Case 3: Session Recovery

**Actor:** Developer restarts machine

**Flow:**
1. Bot stops running
2. User restarts machine
3. User runs `ccpoke` again
4. Bot loads previous sessions from disk
5. Resumes monitoring same tmux sessions
6. No context lost

**Value:** Reliable state persistence

---

### Use Case 4: Multi-Project Coordination

**Actor:** Team with multiple agents running

**Flow:**
1. Alice runs Claude Code in project-a
2. Bob runs Cursor in project-b
3. Both agents' notifications go to shared Telegram group
4. Notifications include project names (no confusion)
5. Team coordinates work without side channel

**Value:** Unified notification center

---

## Competitive Advantages

### 1. Zero-Install via `npx`

**Advantage:** Compare to competitors

| Tool | Installation |
|------|---|
| **ccpoke** | `npx -y ccpoke` — done in 2 seconds |
| six-ddc/ccbot | Clone repo, Python setup, 5+ minutes |
| kidandcat/ccc | Clone, Go build, 10+ minutes |
| CoderBOT | Install, configure, 15+ minutes |

**Moat:** npm ecosystem unique. Python/Go can't replicate.

### 2. Multi-Agent Architecture

**Vision:** Not just Claude Code. Designed for any AI agent.

```
ccpoke adapters → Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Aider, ...
```

**Competitors:** Mostly hardcoded to single agent.

### 3. Plugin System (Future)

**Goal:** Community-driven channels and adapters.

```
ccpoke plugins → community Slack adapter, Discord adapter, Email adapter
```

**Example:** User contributes Slack channel → published via npm.

### 4. i18n Baked In

**Languages:** English, Vietnamese, Chinese (all from day 1)

**Competitors:** English-only, no locale strategy.

**Asian Market:** Vietnamese/Chinese communities underserved.

### 5. Terminal-Aware

**Design:** Bridge INTO existing tmux sessions, not replace them.

```
WRONG:  ccpoke ──(creates new session)──→ Claude Code
RIGHT:  ccpoke ──(bridges)──→ [existing tmux] ──→ Claude Code
```

**Competitors:** Some create separate sessions (lose context).

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance

| Requirement | Target | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Hook latency | < 3s | Timely notifications |
| Message injection | < 2s | Responsive chat |
| Bot memory | < 100MB | Resource constrained (VPS) |
| Setup time | < 2min | Low friction for users |
| Session scan | 30s interval | Balance responsiveness vs CPU |

---

### NFR-2: Reliability

| Requirement | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Hook failure doesn't crash Claude | Try-catch, graceful degradation |
| Message parsing failure | Send generic notification |
| Telegram API timeout | Retry with exponential backoff |
| Session persistence | Periodic sync to disk |
| Graceful shutdown | Close all handles, flush state |

---

### NFR-3: Security

| Requirement | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Hook secret validation | Random 32-char token, header check |
| User whitelist | Telegram user ID check |
| Loopback binding | Listen only on 127.0.0.1 |
| No secrets in logs | Redact tokens, sanitize output |
| Config file permissions | Mode 600 for sensitive files |

---

### NFR-4: Maintainability

| Requirement | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Code clarity | < 200 LOC per file |
| Type safety | TypeScript strict mode |
| Design patterns | Provider, Adapter, Bridge, Observer |
| Test coverage | 80%+ for core logic |
| Documentation | Clear module responsibilities |

---

### NFR-5: Compatibility

| Requirement | Support |
|---|---|
| Node.js version | ≥20 |
| Operating systems | macOS, Linux, Windows (WSL) |
| Terminal | tmux only (primary), bash/zsh shell |
| AI agents | Claude Code, Cursor (extensible) |

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision: Why TypeScript/Node.js?

**Chosen:** TypeScript/Node.js

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Python — Rapid dev, but no `npx` install
2. Go — Single binary, but heavy compilation setup
3. Rust — Type-safe, but overkill for this scale

**Decision Rationale:**
| Factor | TypeScript | Python | Go |
|--------|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| `npx` install | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| npm ecosystem | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Cross-platform | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Setup friction | Low | Medium | Medium |

**Result:** `npx -y ccpoke` is unique competitive advantage.

---

### Decision: Hook vs Polling

**Chosen:** Hybrid (Hook for notifications, optional polling for streaming)

**Approach:**
1. **Tier 1:** Use native hooks (Push-based, chaining)
2. **Tier 2:** Optionally poll JSONL for streaming (Pull-based)
3. **Tier 3:** Real-time output requires polling

**Benefits:**
- Hooks: accurate, low resource
- Polling: detailed, progressive updates

---

### Decision: Single User vs Multi-User

**Chosen:** Single-user (with whitelist for teams)

**Design:**
- Bot runs on personal machine (not server)
- All configuration stored locally (`~/.ccpoke/`)
- User whitelist supports team coordination
- Team shares same bot instance on single machine

**Alternative (not chosen):** Centralized server
- Would require cloud hosting
- Security model much harder
- Unnecessary complexity for primary use case

---

### Decision: Session Persistence

**Chosen:** File-based (`~/.ccpoke/sessions.json`)

**Alternative (not chosen):** SQLite, PostgreSQL
- Overkill for current scale
- Additional dependency
- Setup friction

**Future:** If scale grows (hundreds of sessions), migrate to SQLite.
